# Outline

- Semantic Metadata and Terminologies
- TS4NFDI and its Services

# And now for something completely different...

# Semantic Metadata?

- All meaningful metadata is semantic!
- Semantic does not imply interoperability
- Shared semantics allow for interoperability

# It's all about identifiers!

- `64 61 74 65` $\Rightarrow$ "date" in ASCII/Unicode
- `date` $\Rightarrow$ ? in ?
- `date` $\Rightarrow$ `http://purl.org/dc/terms/date` in DC
- `http://purl.org/dc/terms/date` $\Rightarrow$ "A point or period of time associated with an event in the lifecycle of the resource" in DC
- *data/identifier* $\Rightarrow$ *semantics* in *format/schema/terminology*

# Terminologies give context to identifiers

- **Terminology** (Dublin Core Elements, schema.org...)
- Names ("Date", "Datum"...)
- Description ("A point or period of time...")
- Related entities (`created`, `dateSubmitted`...)
- Rules (ISO 8601-1 date/time value, created < submitted, ...)
- Mappings (`dc:created` = `schema:dateCreated`...)

# Terminology Services 4 NFDI (TS4NFDI)

- BASE4NFDI project, integration phase 2025 & 2026
- Joint effort of ZB Med, InfAI, TIB, RPTU, VZG
- "provision, curation, development, harmonization and mapping of terminologies"
- Standardise and harmonise terminology management within the NFDI

# Working Packages

1. TS4NFDI Service Portal <https://terminology.services.base4nfdi.de/>
2. **Mapping Service** <https://coli-conc.gbv.de/cocoda/ts4nfdi/>
3. Terminology Curation
4. **API Gateway** <https://ts4nfdi.github.io/api-gateway>
5. **Terminology Service Suite** <https://github.com/ts4nfdi/terminology-service-suite>
6. Community engagement, communication, and training

# API Gateway

- Meta search for terminology services\
  (OLS, OntoPortal, Skosmos, JSKOS, GND...)
- Server-side integration: one API to query them all
- Create and publish collections/lists of terminologies

# Mapping Service

- Create and review mappings with a nice UI
- Create, edit, annotate mappings via API

# Terminology Service Suite

- React library to interact with terminologies
- Search, Infobox, Tree-view...
- Common data model to be used with API Gateway

# Please contact us!

- Have a look and try out!
- Incubators: Bring you use cases!

# Limitations and related projects

- Most data formats are not terminologies
- But they often make use of terminologies
- Current MOD data model lacks multilinguality and mappings (have a look at JSKOS instead)
- Similar client-side integration with cocoda-sdk
- Project BARTOC: Terminology Registry build with data librarians
